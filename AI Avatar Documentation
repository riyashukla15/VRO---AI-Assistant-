üß† Overview

The AI Avatar component is a core interactive element of our VRO system. This avatar serves as the visual and conversational face of the the shopping assistant: a digital agent who interacts with users in a natural, human-like manner.

Creates a more immersive and human-centered shopping experience.
When combined with voice synthesis and gesture design, it mimics human interaction to guide fashion discovery.
